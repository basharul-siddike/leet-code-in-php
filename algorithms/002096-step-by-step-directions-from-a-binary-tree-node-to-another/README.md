2096\. Step-By-Step Directions From a Binary Tree Node to Another

Medium 

You are given the `root` of a **binary tree** with `n` nodes. Each node is uniquely assigned a value from `1` to `n`. You are also given an integer `startValue` representing the value of the start node `s`, and a different integer `destValue` representing the value of the destination node `t`.

Find the **shortest path** starting from node `s` and ending at node `t`. Generate step-by-step directions of such path as a string consisting of only the **uppercase** letters `'L'`, `'R'`, and `'U'`. Each letter indicates a specific direction:

- `'L'` means to go from a node to its **left child** node.
- `'R'` means to go from a node to its **right child** node.
- `'U'` means to go from a node to its **parent** node.

Return _the step-by-step directions of the **shortest path** from node s to node t_.

**Example 1:**

![eg1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/11/15/eg1.png)

- **Input:** root = [5,1,2,3,null,6,4], startValue = 3, destValue = 6
- **Output:** "UURL"
- **Explanation:** The shortest path is: 3 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 5 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 6.

**Example 2:**

![eg2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/11/15/eg2.png)

- **Input:** root = [2,1], startValue = 2, destValue = 1
- **Output:** "L"
- **Explanation:** The shortest path is: 2 ‚Üí 1.

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is `n`.
- <code>2 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
- `1 <= Node.val <= n`
- All the values in the tree are **unique**.
- `1 <= startValue, destValue <= n`
- `startValue != destValue`


**Hint:**
1. The shortest path between any two nodes in a tree must pass through their Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA). The path will travel upwards from node s to the LCA and then downwards from the LCA to node t.
2. Find the path strings from root ‚Üí s, and root ‚Üí t. Can you use these two strings to prepare the final answer?
3. Remove the longest common prefix of the two path strings to get the path LCA ‚Üí s, and LCA ‚Üí t. Each step in the path of LCA ‚Üí s should be reversed as 'U'.

**Solution:**


To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Find the path from the root to the start node (s) and the destination node (t): This can be done using Depth-First Search (DFS).
2. Find the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of the start and destination nodes: The LCA is the lowest node in the tree that has both s and t as descendants.
3. Construct the path from s to the LCA and from the LCA to t: The path from s to the LCA will be in reverse order and all directions will be 'U'. The path from the LCA to t will be in the natural order.
4. Combine these paths to form the final path: This will give the shortest path from s to t.

Let's implement this solution in PHP: **[2096. Step-By-Step Directions From a Binary Tree Node to Another](https://github.com/mah-shamim/leet-code-in-php/tree/main/algorithms/002096-step-by-step-directions-from-a-binary-tree-node-to-another/solution.php)**

```php
<?php
// Example usage:
$root = new TreeNode(5);
$root->left = new TreeNode(1);
$root->right = new TreeNode(2);
$root->left->left = new TreeNode(3);
$root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
$root->right->right = new TreeNode(4);

$startValue = 3;
$destValue = 6;
echo getDirections($root, $startValue, $destValue); // Outputs: "UURL"

$root2 = new TreeNode(5);
$root2->left = new TreeNode(1);
$root2->right = new TreeNode(2);
$root2->left->left = new TreeNode(3);
$root2->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
$root2->right->right = new TreeNode(4);

$startValue2 = 3;
$destValue2 = 6;
echo getDirections($root2, $startValue2, $destValue2); // Outputs: "L"

?>
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`TreeNode` Class:** A simple class to represent a node in the binary tree.
2. **`findPath` Function:** This function finds the path from the root to the given value and stores the path in the provided array (`$path`). It uses DFS and marks each step with `'L'` for left and `'R'` for right.
3. **`getDirections` Function:** This function uses `findPath` to get the paths from the root to `startValue` and `destValue`. It then finds the common path length (LCA). The number of `'U'` moves is the difference in length between the start path and the common path. The remaining path to the destination node is appended.
4. **Example Usage:** Creates the binary tree as shown in the example, and calls `getDirections` with `startValue` and `destValue`. The result is the string representing the shortest path.
